Student Portal is a web application which provide web based student activity management system for all college/school students in order to introduce more reliability and transparency in information exchange activities e.g. exam notification, gate pass details and many more.  This application will be implemented as MEAN/Full Stack application followed by MVC architecture. This will be a RESTful web service.

## BUSINESS CONTEXT
The objective is to develop a RESTful web application that can be easily adopted by customer (student/college/school) to make the educational processes/activities faster, safer and maintainable. The framework should be built in a way that ensures lower maintenance efforts and maximum re-usability.Server and client apps will be individually deployed on Heroku cloud and communicates between them will be established through REST API call over HTTP protocol.

## USE CASES
The Application is designed to provide user specific functionality. There will be two users of this application: 

### Admin

- Can enrol the students with a unique registration number
- Can send email to all the students with their registration numbers to register on the portal using it.

- Can register themselves using registration number provided by admin
- Can change or reset their password.
- Can apply for the leave.
- Can update their profile detailsâ€¢Can download exam time table/exam gate pass

## PROCESS FLOW

### Application Deployment
The code for the client and the server app will be maintained in the git repository. For each small functionality, a new pull request will be opened and once that pull request is merged to the master repository, latest code will be automatically deployed to the cloud. The Automatic deployment from git will be configured. The URL of the application will be shared, once the development being finished.

### Application Testing
When the application will be hosted on the cloud with all functionality,a basic testing will be carried out by postman to check each functionality. Postman will be used for this testing,specially the CRUD operations.

## TARGET ENVIRONMENT
The installation of the tools required to work on the capstone project is already covered in the courses that are part of this masters program. Install these tools and solve the project problem.

## TASKS
Following are the tasks, which need to be developed while executing the project:
1.Client and Server end code through git repository.
2.MongoDB free account credentials.
3.Heroku based application URLto be used. 
4.Functionality document with screenshot. (This will be optional)
